# loan-picker
This is a web app I made for my Data Incubator capstone project, featuring some tools I made for analyzing peer-to-peer lending data. 
Specifically, Lending Club's publically available dataset.

Currently it needs a home. Feel free to clone it and run the Flask app locally. Requirements are listed in the requirements.txt and conda-requirements.txt files.
